# Mounting Hole Adapter

Did you make a hole that was too big to fit your part? Or are you replacing an
existing mounted part with a smaller one? Welcome to the customisable mounting
hole adapter.

Print the mounting hole adapter to fit your small part into the bigger hole, and
print the optional washer if you want to screw the adapter in using the new
part's threads.

Model is customisable, OpenSCAD source provided. Let me know if any of the
descriptions are unclear.
